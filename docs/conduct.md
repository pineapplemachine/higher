# Higher Code of Conduct

While using or contributing to higher, please observe that:

**Everyone who works on and with higher matters.** And so do people who haven't even heard of higher, or who have and don't like it. Do not verbally (or otherwise) attack other people. Do not purposefully and senselessly offend them. Respect their needs and their feelings.

**Everyone's perspectives matter.** When contributing to higher, listen to what people have to say about your contributions and how they might affect their own use of higher. _Your_ perspective matters, too. Please don't hesitate to yourself express helpful feedback.

**Higher is a cooperative endeavor.** Respect and understanding is absolutely necessary to sustain a cooperative environment. Remain aware of how your own way of working is affecting other people. And it's not a competition, so don't undercut other people's efforts.

Those who do not so observe may be disallowed from contributing to higher.

**Examples of appropriate behavior include:**

- Giving constructive feedback and criticism to other contributors.
- Helping others to feel welcome in sharing their perspective.
- Using inclusive language.

**Examples of inappropriate behavior include:**

- Trivializing the experiences and perspectives of others.
- Insulting others, their contributions, or their opinions.
- Using slurs or making bigoted remarks or jokes.
- Revealing others' personal information without their consent.

**If someone is acting inappropriately,** please contact one of the project owners, [@pineapplemachine](https://github.com/pineapplemachine) or [@jpsullivan](https://github.com/jpsullivan).
