        warnings: (`
            Some sequence types implement a collapseBreak method because they
            must be specially handled when being collapsed. Every such sequence
            in the chain of the sequence that is being collapsed entails a
            performance penalty; for smaller sequences or chains with few breaks
            this should be negligible, but if the sequence is long or the chain
            contains many breaks, it may be more efficient to produce a new
            array out-of-place instead using the @array function.
        `),
        trivia: (`
            Sequence types with a collapseBreak method necessitate writing their
            contents fully to the array before continuing up the sequence chain,
            and may cause a substantial performance impact for very long
            sequences. For long sequences or sequences with many breaks in their
            chain, it may be preferable to produce an out-of-place array.
            
            Collapsing is not possible if any sequence in the chain that follows
            one with a collapseBreak method does not support a rebase operation,
            or if a sequence itself having a collapseBreak method does not
            support a rebase operation.
            This failure would indicate an issue with a sequence implementation,
            not a usage error.
